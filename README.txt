M04-A03 Two Implemented Use Cases with Clean, Refactored Code

We implemented our refactoring plan by generating javadocs, commenting code, and creating unit tests.

The documentation can be generated within NetBeans. Once generated it can be found in target/site/apidocs.

Classes affected:
Notifications.java - Leon & William
PatientController.java - Leon & Adam
Vitals.java - Adam
PrinterController.java - Leon
Test Packages - Adam

New use cases:
- We implemented patient notifications, found in the Main page.
- We implemented patient reports, found in the Reports page. 
- We added the ability to export reports via print.
